Make sure your input file is called TraderVehicleParts.txt or you will get no output file

Either drag your input file onto the ConvertTraderVehiclePartsv0.3 executable and your output file will be created in the same folder as your input file. Or put the executable and the input file in the same location and run the exectable to create the output in whichever folder they are in when you run the converter.

Dont complain if it doesnt work perfectly, this is the first .exe file I have ever created XD
